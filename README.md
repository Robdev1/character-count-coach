# character-count-coach
Analyzes short text for suitability as headlines, tweets, metadescriptions and other uses. Provides some suggestions.

The code assesses short texts based on character count. 

The top of the page takes texts intended as headlines. The code not only counts the characters and counts down the number of remaining characters, but also displays the heads at standard and selected font sizes.

The program looks at their potential as tweets.

If the text is too long for a headline, this is noted and the following assessments are generated.

If a text is shorter than 140 characters, the code suggests standard ways to use the remaining characters in tweet. The short texts are also analyzed as potential metadescriptions, which best practice recommends limiting to 160 characters.

The code also succinctly coaches the writer on how to be brief when writing:
* Internet Relay Chat posts
* Facebook posts
* Drupal code that complies with the 80 character per line standard
* 256-character limits for file paths or other uses
